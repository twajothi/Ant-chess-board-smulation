# Ant-chess-board-smulation

Two ants start in opposite corners of a regular chessboard.
  Every 10 seconds, they move from the center of the square they're on to the
  center of an adjacent square. How long until they both land on the same
  square? How long until their paths cross (Ant A moving from square K to L and
  Ant B moving from square L to K)? What happens if we allow the ants to move
  diagonally? What happens if we restrict ants from moving to their immediately
 previous square?
